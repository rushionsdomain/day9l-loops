# JavaScript Looping Constructs

This repository provides examples and explanations of various looping constructs available in JavaScript. Looping is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

## Loop Types

JavaScript supports several types of loops, each with its own use cases and syntax. Below is a comprehensive list of all loop constructs in JavaScript.

### 1. `for` Loop
The `for` loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### 2. `while` Loop
The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### 3. `do...while` Loop
The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code once before checking the condition.

```javascript
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

### 4. `for...in` Loop
The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### 5. `for...of` Loop
The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.

```javascript
for (let value of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### 6. `Array.prototype.forEach`
The `forEach` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

```javascript
array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
    // code block to be executed
});
```

## Usage

Each loop type is demonstrated in the repository with comments and example code. To use these examples:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rushionsdomain/day9l-loops.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd js-looping-constructs
    ```

3. Open the examples in your preferred code editor and run them using Node.js or in your browser's console.
